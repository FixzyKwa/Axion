# Axion Client
AntiCheat & Security Approach

Axion Client comes with internally developed Axion AntiCheat, designed to protect the integrity of gameplay within the Axion ecosystem. The system constantly evolves alongside the client to maintain a secure and fair environment.

User identity and authenticity are handled by our custom AxA (Axion Authentication Authority), a verification layer built to secure logins, client sessions, and ecosystem access. This authentication model originated from early prototype tests and will continue to expand as the client matures.



Open Source Transparency

Axion Client follows a hybrid development philosophy:

Core engine components benefit from research transparency, internal prototyping, and community feedback loops

However, the client is not planned to be fully open source

Some modules, including security, authentication, and anti-tampering logic, will remain proprietary


Certain public-facing elements, such as previous HTML-based UI animation tests and prototypes, will serve as reference models for future integration, but do not reflect the complete internal source code of the client.

This approach allows us to maintain both innovation freedom and ecosystem security without exposing critical systems to misuse.



Axion is built to evolve openly in concept, but selectively in code — ensuring a safer and stronger client for everyone.
